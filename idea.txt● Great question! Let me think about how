● Great question! Let me think about how to properly match user preferences with present attributes for
  better recommendations.

  Current Data Structure:
  // User has:
  {
    "age": "25-34",
    "gender": "f"
  }

  // Present has:
  {
    "age": "18-24",           // Target age
    "gender": "f",            // Target gender  
    "category": "beauty",     // Product category
    "suitable_for": "friend", // Relationship type
    "acquaintance_level": "friendly"
  }

  Matching Strategy Options:

  Option 1: Multi-dimensional Matching
  user_profile = {
    "product_preferences": {"beauty": 0.6, "books": 0.4},  // Categories of items they liked
    "demographic_targeting": {"age": "25-34", "gender": "f"}  // User's own demographics
  }

  # Matching logic:
  # 1. Find presents where present.category matches user.product_preferences
  # 2. Filter by presents where present.age/gender matches user.demographic_targeting  
  # 3. Score by combination of both factors

  Option 2: User Behavior-Based
  # Focus on what they actually liked, not demographics
  user_profile = {
    "liked_categories": {"beauty": 0.6, "sweet": 0.3, "books": 0.1},
    "liked_age_targets": {"18-24": 0.4, "25-34": 0.6},  // Age groups they buy for
    "liked_relationships": {"friend": 0.7, "relative": 0.3}  // Who they buy for
  }

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
  user_profile = {
    "category_preferences": {"beauty": 0.6, "books": 0.4},  // What they like
    "buying_patterns": {
      "target_ages": {"18-24": 0.3, "25-34": 0.7},      // Ages they buy for
      "relationships": {"friend": 0.6, "relative": 0.4},  // Who they buy for
      "gender_targets": {"f": 0.8, "any": 0.2}          // Gender they buy for
    }
  }

  My Recommendation: Option 3 - Hybrid Approach

  Why? Because:
  1. Product preferences = what categories they actually like
  2. Buying patterns = who they typically buy gifts for (might differ from their own demographics)
  3. More accurate = a 30-year-old woman might buy "teen" gifts for her younger sister

  Implementation:
  1. Extract category from liked presents → category_preferences
  2. Extract age, suitable_for, gender from liked presents → buying_patterns
  3. Match presents using both dimensions with weighted scoring

  What do you think? Should we go with this hybrid approach?
